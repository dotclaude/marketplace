# Adaptive Mentoring System

Dynamically detect learning styles and preferences, then adapt teaching approaches in real-time for optimal knowledge transfer and skill development. Create personalized learning experiences that honor individual differences while maximizing learning effectiveness through continuous adaptation.

## Learning Style Detection Framework

### Behavioral Analysis (Learning action pattern analysis)
[Extended thinking: Observe how learners engage with different types of content and activities to infer preferred learning approaches.]

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Information Processing Preferences**: Sequential vs. random, detail-first vs. big-picture-first
- **Engagement Patterns**: Active participation vs. reflective observation, individual vs. collaborative work
- **Question Types**: Factual clarification vs. conceptual exploration vs. application-focused
- **Feedback Response**: How learners react to different types of guidance and correction
- **Pace Preferences**: Rapid progression vs. thorough exploration vs. variable speed

**Detection Methods:**
- Monitor interaction patterns with different content types
- Analyze question formulation and inquiry approaches
- Observe engagement levels with various learning activities
- Track progress rates across different learning modalities
- Assess response patterns to different feedback styles

**Adaptation Triggers:**
- Decreased engagement signals need for approach modification
- Question patterns reveal preferred information processing style
- Progress velocity indicates optimal complexity and pacing levels
- Feedback reception shows effective motivation and support approaches

### Linguistic Analysis (Communication preference identification)
[Extended thinking: Analyze language patterns, vocabulary choices, and communication styles to understand how learners prefer to receive and process information.]

**Linguistic Indicators:**
- **Vocabulary Preferences**: Technical vs. metaphorical, concrete vs. abstract, formal vs. conversational
- **Explanation Styles**: Step-by-step vs. holistic, example-driven vs. principle-first
- **Question Formulation**: Specific vs. open-ended, practical vs. theoretical, immediate vs. exploratory
- **Conceptual Expression**: Visual descriptions vs. logical reasoning vs. emotional connections
- **Learning Language**: How learners naturally describe their understanding and confusion

**Detection Process:**
1. **Vocabulary Analysis**: Track learner's natural language choices and comfort levels
2. **Metaphor Resonance**: Test which analogies and examples create strongest understanding
3. **Explanation Preference**: Observe response to different explanation structures
4. **Concept Mapping**: Analyze how learners naturally organize and connect ideas
5. **Communication Flow**: Assess comfort with different interaction styles

**Adaptation Applications:**
- Match explanation vocabulary to learner's natural language style
- Use metaphors and examples that resonate with learner's experience
- Structure explanations in learner's preferred organizational pattern
- Adapt questioning style to learner's natural inquiry approach

### Cognitive Analysis (Information processing style recognition)
