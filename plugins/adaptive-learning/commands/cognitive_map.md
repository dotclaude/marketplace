# Cognitive Mapping Engine

Create visual representations of knowledge relationships, conceptual bridges, and understanding pathways to facilitate learning transfer and pattern recognition. Transform abstract knowledge into concrete visual structures that reveal hidden connections and support deep comprehension.

## Mapping Style Framework

### Hierarchical Style (Tree-like knowledge organization)
[Extended thinking: Organize concepts in structured hierarchy with clear parent-child relationships and logical categorization. Optimal for understanding domains with clear organizational structure.]

**Structure Characteristics:**
- **Root Concepts**: Fundamental principles that anchor entire knowledge domain
- **Branch Categories**: Major subdivisions that organize related concepts
- **Leaf Details**: Specific implementations, examples, and concrete applications
- **Inheritance Patterns**: How properties and characteristics flow from general to specific
- **Abstraction Levels**: Clear distinction between conceptual levels and detail depths

**Visual Representation:**
```
Domain Architecture
├── Foundational Principles
│   ├── Core Concept A
│   │   ├── Implementation Pattern 1
│   │   ├── Implementation Pattern 2
│   │   └── Real-world Application
│   └── Core Concept B
│       ├── Variation A
│       └── Variation B
├── Advanced Applications
│   ├── Complex Pattern 1
│   └── Complex Pattern 2
└── Integration Strategies
    ├── Cross-domain Application
    └── Future Evolution Paths
```

### Network Style (Interconnected concept relationships)
[Extended thinking: Map complex interdependencies where concepts connect in multiple ways without clear hierarchy. Optimal for understanding systems with rich interconnections.]

**Connection Types:**

           ↕                    ↕
    [Supporting Idea] ←→ [Integration Point] ←→ [Application Domain]
           ↕                    ↕                      ↕
    [Implementation] ←→ [Cross-Domain Bridge] ←→ [Future Possibility]
```

### Flow Style (Process and causation mapping)

       ↓                                    ↓
[Context Input] → [Process Step 2] → [Alternative Path] → [Outcome B]
       ↑                                    ↑
[Feedback Loop] ← [Learning Integration] ← [Synthesis Point]
```

### Matrix Style (Multi-dimensional comparison grids)
[Extended thinking: Compare concepts across multiple dimensions simultaneously to reveal patterns and relationships. Optimal for understanding complex trade-offs and multi-criteria analysis.]

**Matrix Dimensions:**
- **Concept Categories**: Different types or classes of concepts being compared
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Different dimensions for assessment or analysis
- **Context Variables**: Different situations or conditions affecting concept application
- **Quality Attributes**: Different characteristics or properties of concepts

**Visual Representation:**
```
                 | Criteria A | Criteria B | Criteria C
Concept 1        |    High    |    Low     |   Medium
Concept 2        |   Medium   |   High     |    High
Concept 3        |    Low     |   Medium   |     Low
Cross-Pattern    | Pattern X  | Pattern Y  | Pattern Z
```

### Journey Style (Learning pathway visualization)
[Extended thinking: Map learning progression with waypoints, milestones, and alternative routes. Optimal for understanding skill development and knowledge acquisition paths.]

**Journey Elements:**
- **Starting Point**: Current knowledge state or skill level
- **Learning Milestones**: Key understanding achievements along the path
- **Skill Checkpoints**: Practical capabilities gained at each stage
- **Alternative Routes**: Different approaches to reaching same destination
- **Integration Opportunities**: Where different learning paths connect or reinforce

**Visual Representation:**
```
[Beginner] → [Foundation] → [Intermediate] → [Advanced] → [Expert]
     ↓           ↓              ↓             ↓          ↓
[Practice] → [Pattern Recognition] → [Creative Application] → [Innovation]
     ↑           ↑              ↑             ↑          ↑
[Resources] → [Community] → [Projects] → [Mentorship] → [Leadership]
