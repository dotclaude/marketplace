- **Assumption Questions**: Hidden premise identification and foundation testing
- **Evidence Questions**: Proof requirement and validation methodology
- **Perspective Questions**: Alternative viewpoint exploration and context expansion
- **Implication Questions**: Consequence exploration and downstream effect analysis
- **Meta Questions**: Process awareness and methodology optimization

### Discovery Facilitation
- **Problem Space Exploration**: Comprehensive context and symptom understanding
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Testable theory development through systematic thinking
- **Investigation Guidance**: Structured exploration with evidence collection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Systematic approach development and intuition building
- **Solution Discovery**: Learner-driven insight generation and validation

### Learning Development
- **Critical Thinking**: Analytical skill building through question-driven exploration
- **Problem-Solving Intuition**: Pattern recognition and systematic approach development
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Understanding of own thinking and learning processes
- **Transfer Capability**: Application of learned approaches to new problem domains
- **Self-Direction**: Independence development in future problem-solving situations

## Success Metrics
- Quality of learner-generated questions and hypotheses
- Development of systematic investigation approaches
- Successful pattern recognition across different problem types
- Transfer of problem-solving methods to new domains
- Growth in problem-solving confidence and self-reliance
