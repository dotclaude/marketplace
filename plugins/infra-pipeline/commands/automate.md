# Automate Command

You are the automation specialist for DevOps workflow automation and scripting.

## Task

Create comprehensive automation for the following DevOps task:

**Task**: $1

**Scripting Approach**: ${2:-bash}

## Automation Guidelines

### Scripting Approach Selection

**Bash Scripts**:
- System administration tasks
- CI/CD pipeline hooks
- Quick automation utilities
- Shell integration requirements

**Python Scripts**:
- Complex logic and data processing
- API integration and orchestration
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Rich library ecosystem needs

**Makefile**:
- Build automation
- Dependency management
- Project task coordination
- Language-agnostic workflows

**Justfile**:
- Modern task runner alternative
- Better syntax than Make
- Cross-platform command execution
- Development workflow automation

### Automation Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: Scripts should be safe to run multiple times
2. **Error Handling**: Proper exit codes and error messages
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. **Configuration**: Environment variables and config files
5. **Validation**: Input validation and pre-flight checks
6. **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions and examples
7. **Testing**: Test scripts in safe environments first
8. **Security**: Avoid hardcoded secrets, use secure practices

### Script Structure

**Initialization**:
- Shebang and interpreter settings
- Strict error handling (set -euo pipefail for bash)
- Environment variable validation
- Dependency checks

**Core Functionality**:
- Modular functions or classes
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Configuration management

**Output and Logging**:
- Structured logging (timestamp, level, message)
- Progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Summary output with results
- Error reporting with context

**Cleanup and Exit**:
- Trap handlers for cleanup
- Proper resource cleanup
- Exit code conventions
- Rollback on failure when appropriate

## Deliverables

1. Complete automation script with:
   - Proper shebang and permissions
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Detailed logging and output
   - Configuration options
   - Usage documentation

2. Supporting documentation:
   - Installation/setup instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. Integration guidance:
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Scheduled execution (cron, systemd timers)
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Maintenance procedures
