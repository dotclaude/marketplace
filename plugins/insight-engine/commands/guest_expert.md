## Execution Examples

### Example 1: Technical Consultation
```bash
guest_expert "machine-learning" "How should I handle class imbalance in my fraud detection model?" --expertise-depth=specialist --perspective-count=1 --style=practical
```

**Specialist ML Engineer Response:**
"Class imbalance in fraud detection is a classic challenge I've seen in dozens of production systems. You're dealing with maybe 0.1-1% fraud cases, which creates several specific problems: your model will bias toward the majority class, precision/recall metrics become misleading, and traditional accuracy measures are worthless.

Here's my systematic approach: First, don't just oversample with SMOTE - in fraud detection, synthetic samples often don't capture the subtle patterns real fraudsters use. Instead, try undersampling the majority class combined with ensemble methods like Random Forest or XGBoost that handle imbalance naturally.

For evaluation, forget accuracy completely. Focus on precision-recall curves, especially precision at high recall levels - you need to catch fraud even if it means more false positives. F2-score is better than F1 because recall matters more than precision in fraud prevention.

Consider cost-sensitive learning - set your class weights based on actual business impact. A missed fraud case might cost $500, while a false positive costs $2 in manual review time. Build that ratio into your model.

Finally, stratify your train/validation splits by time, not randomly. Fraudsters evolve, so you need temporal validation to test real-world performance."

### Example 2: Strategic Business Consultation
```bash
guest_expert "product-strategy" "Should we build our own analytics platform or integrate with existing solutions?" --expertise-depth=authority --perspective-count=2 --style=strategic
```

**Authority Product Strategist Response:**
"This build-vs-buy decision touches core product strategy and I've guided dozens of companies through similar crossroads. Let me give you two perspectives that matter most:

**Strategic Differentiation Lens:**
Ask yourself: Does analytics capability create competitive differentiation for your core value proposition? If you're in fintech, healthcare, or ecommerce, analytics might be core IP that justifies building. If you're in logistics or manufacturing, analytics is likely enabling infrastructure that should be bought.

I've seen companies waste 2+ years building analytics platforms that never matched Segment, Mixpanel, or Amplitude's sophistication. But I've also seen companies like Netflix or Uber whose custom analytics became core competitive advantages.

**Resource Allocation Reality:**
Building enterprise-grade analytics means 3-5 senior engineers for 12-18 months, plus ongoing maintenance. That's $1.5-3M investment that could alternatively fund 2-3 major product features that directly serve customers.

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Start with best-in-class third-party solution (Segment + Amplitude/Mixpanel). Validate that analytics drives real business decisions. If you hit platform limitations or competitive differentiation needs emerge, then consider building custom components on top of existing infrastructure.

The companies that successfully build custom analytics have crystal-clear competitive advantage thesis and dedicated platform teams. For most product organizations, buying gives you analytics capability in weeks versus years, letting you focus resources on features that differentiate your core value proposition."

### Example 3: Creative Domain Consultation
```bash
guest_expert "ux-design" "How can I improve user onboarding for a complex B2B software platform?" --expertise-depth=practitioner --perspective-count=1 --style=hands-on
```

**Senior UX Designer Response:**
"B2B onboarding is my specialty - I've designed onboarding flows for everything from CRM platforms to enterprise security tools. Complex software creates unique challenges because users need to understand both the tool AND their workflow changes.

Here's my battle-tested approach:

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern**: Don't show everything at once. Start with single primary action that delivers immediate value. For project management software, that's creating their first project, not touring every feature. I use the '5-minute value' rule - users should accomplish something meaningful within 5 minutes.

**Role-Based Flows**: B2B software serves different user types. Create separate onboarding paths for admins, end-users, and decision-makers. I typically design 3 distinct flows with different success criteria. Admin onboarding focuses on setup and control, end-user onboarding focuses on daily workflow, decision-maker onboarding focuses on reporting and ROI visibility.

**Interactive Tutorials Over Videos**: Users learn complex software by doing, not watching. I build interactive tutorials using tools like Intro.js or Shepherd.js that overlay directly on the actual interface. Users perform real actions with their real data, not demo scenarios.

**Completion Psychology**: Break onboarding into clear steps with progress indicators. I use the 'setup wizard' pattern - user information, team setup, first project, first task, first collaboration. Each step ends with a small celebration and clear next step.

**Early Warning System**: Instrument everything to identify drop-off points. Users who don't complete step 3 within 48 hours get personalized outreach. I track 'activation metrics' - specific actions that predict long-term retention."
