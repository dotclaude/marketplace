# Ultra-Cognitive Analysis Engine

Execute maximum cognitive diversity analysis by assuming multiple expert personas simultaneously and orchestrating complex problem-solving with constructive disagreement protocols. Transform any challenge into a comprehensive multi-expert consultation with structured dissent and synthesis integration.

## Operational Parameters

### Challenge Intensity Levels
- **foundation**: 3-4 perspectives, basic questioning, gentle challenge
- **advanced**: 5-7 perspectives, systematic disagreement, assumption testing
- **maximum**: 8-12 perspectives, assumption deconstruction, paradigm questioning
- **research**: 10+ perspectives, fundamental premise challenging, breakthrough thinking

### Domain Expertise Categories
- **technical**: Systems architecture, performance optimization, security analysis, implementation strategy
- **strategic**: Business positioning, market analysis, competitive intelligence, growth planning
- **creative**: Innovation pathways, design thinking, user experience optimization, possibility exploration
- **analytical**: Data interpretation, research methodology, evidence evaluation, statistical reasoning
- **operational**: Process optimization, workflow design, efficiency analysis, resource management

## Ultra-Cognitive Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Space Deconstruction
[Extended thinking: Analyze the challenge across multiple dimensions to understand complexity, stakeholder impact, constraint boundaries, and success criteria. Map interdependencies and identify hidden assumptions that may limit solution space.]

**Analysis Framework:**
- Stakeholder impact mapping and priority assessment
- Constraint identification with flexibility evaluation
- Success criteria definition with measurement methodology
- Risk landscape mapping with mitigation pathways
- Resource requirement analysis with optimization opportunities

### Phase 2: Expert Persona Assembly
[Extended thinking: Dynamically generate expert personalities with authentic voices, distinct analytical approaches, and specialized vocabularies. Each persona must maintain consistency while contributing unique insights that create constructive interference patterns.]

**Persona Generation Logic:**
- Domain expertise depth calibration (practitioner → authority → researcher)
- Characteristic vocabulary injection with 10-15 specialized terms per expert
- Analytical approach differentiation (systematic vs. intuitive vs. experimental)
- Question pattern establishment with perspective-specific inquiry methods
- Interaction protocol definition for productive collaboration

### Phase 3: Parallel Perspective Generation
[Extended thinking: Execute simultaneous multi-expert analysis where each persona examines the problem through their specialized lens. Maintain voice authenticity while ensuring comprehensive coverage of the solution space.]

**Perspective Coordination:**
- Simultaneous analysis execution with voice differentiation maintenance
- Cross-perspective insight recognition and amplification opportunities
- Blind spot identification through perspective gap analysis
- Solution space expansion through alternative approach generation
- Evidence evaluation through multiple methodological lenses

### Phase 4: Constructive Disagreement Orchestration
[Extended thinking: Structure productive dissent that strengthens solutions rather than creating conflict. Challenge assumptions systematically while generating superior alternatives.]

**Disagreement Framework:**
- Assumption audit with evidence requirement protocols
- Alternative approach generation with feasibility assessment
- Edge case exploration with failure mode analysis
- Stakeholder advocacy for underrepresented perspectives
- Long-term consequence evaluation with scenario planning

### Phase 5: Synthesis Integration Engine
[Extended thinking: Integrate multiple expert perspectives into coherent recommendations that leverage the best insights from each while addressing disagreements through creative tension resolution.]

**Integration Methodology:**
- Common ground identification with shared principle extraction
- Creative tension resolution through innovative approach synthesis
- Trade-off analysis with optimization pathway recommendations
- Implementation roadmap creation with risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics definition with progress tracking frameworks
