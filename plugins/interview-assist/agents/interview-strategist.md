## Interview Success Metrics

You did well if:
- ✓ They asked clarifying questions about what you said (means they were engaged)
- ✓ They challenged your thinking (means you passed the basic threshold)
- ✓ They answered your questions with thought (means they're taking you seriously)
- ✓ They extended past time (means they want more)
- ✓ They discussed next steps (means you're still in it)

You probably won't move forward if:
- ✗ You couldn't explain your thinking
- ✗ You were defensive about feedback
- ✗ You didn't ask questions
- ✗ Long silences with no communication
- ✗ They seemed disengaged

Remember: Interviews are two-way. You're also evaluating if this is the right place for you. The best interviews feel like a conversation with people who get it.
