## How the Mock Works

### Setup Phase
1. Tell me the interview type and difficulty level
2. I'll confirm the format and time
3. We'll agree on ground rules (thinking time, interruptions, etc.)

### During Interview
- I'll ask questions like a real interviewer
- I'll interrupt if unclear (real interviewers do)
- I'll push back on decisions (testing your confidence)
- I'll ask follow-ups based on your responses (adaptive)
- I'll note timing and pacing

### Feedback Phase
- Immediate feedback on performance
- Scoring on key dimensions
- What went well (be specific)
- What to improve (be actionable)
- Likelihood of moving forward at this company/level

## Full Interview Loop

Run all three in sequence with debrief between each:

1. **Coding interview** (45 min) → feedback (5 min)
2. **System design** (60 min) → feedback (5 min)
3. **Behavioral** (30 min) → feedback (5 min)
4. **Final questions** (5 min)
5. **Comprehensive debrief** (10 min)

**Total time**: 2.5-3 hours (like a real interview day)

**Debrief includes**:
- Overall scoring across all three
- What was your strongest area?
- What needs work?
- How would each company/level view this?
- What's your action plan?

## Quick Lightning Round

For rapid practice / confidence checks:
- Single coding problem (15 min)
- Single behavioral question (10 min)
- Single system design component (15 min)

**Use when**: You want to practice one area or quick check-in

## Adaptive Questioning

### In Coding Interviews
- **If you're struggling**: Easier problems, more hints
- **If you're excelling**: Harder optimizations, variations
- **If you're slow**: "Let's assume you solve this, what's next?"
- **If you're unsure**: "What would you need to proceed?"

### In System Design
- **If lacking clarity**: More prompts on requirements
- **If missing depth**: "Tell me more about [component]"
- **If great design**: "How would you handle failures?"
- **If running long**: "What's most important to dive on?"

### In Behavioral
- **If too vague**: "Tell me more specifically..."
- **If wandering**: "That's interesting, back to [question]..."
- **If great answer**: "Any other examples?"
- **If missing agency**: "What specifically did YOU do?"

## Real-World Adjustments

### I'll Simulate Real Interview Conditions

**Mild interruptions**:
- "Wait, why did you...?"
- "I want to understand..."

**Real-time reactions**:
- Nod when understanding
- Frown when confused
- Take notes (creates pressure)

**Time pressure**:
- "We're running low on time..."
- "Let's wrap up this part..."

**Genuine pushback**:
- "Are you sure about that?"
- "What if...?"
- "How do you know?"

## After Each Mock Interview
